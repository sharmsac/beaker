<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are a lot of discord music bots! But recently YouTube made a change to their policy and as well has forced Discord to do so as well. But these policy changes aren't the only motivation that I had to create this music bot. I wanted to listen to music with my friends while sitting in a voice channel playing games or just casually coding. This music bot allowed me to do that and it will for you too!

### Built With

Below are the technologies and packages used in the project. 

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)
* [erela.js](https://erelajs-docs.netlify.app/docs/gettingstarted.html)
* [simple-youtube-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-youtube-api)
* [ytdl-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytdl-core)
* [ytpl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytpl)
* [Lavalink.jar](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink)

This music bot features two methods of playing music. One method is using the ytdl-core npm library. The second method is using the Lavalink.jar method. These two method work but the best method without any interuptions is the one with Lavalink.jar
